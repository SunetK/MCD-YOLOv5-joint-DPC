# MCD-YOLOv5-joint-DPC
The detection and analysis of molecular clumps can lead to a better understanding of the star formation in the Milky Way galaxy. Herein, we present a molecular-clump-detection method based on an improved YOLOv5 joint Density Peak Clustering (DPC). We use an improved YOLOv5 to detect the positions of molecular clumps on the galactic plane to obtaining the spatial information. We use DPC algorithm to combine the detection results in the velocity direction.
